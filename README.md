> ### `About Our Team`
Our team name is <strong>RANDOM</strong>.

<P>Why <strong>RANDOM</strong>? because, just like our decision-making process, it was totally unpredictable! Some say we spun a wheel, threw darts at a dictionary, and let a cat walk on a keyboard. But hey, we believe in the power of randomness — because when life gives you lemons, sometimes you just need a bunch of random letters to make lemonade!
